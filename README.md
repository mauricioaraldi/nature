Random life simulation experiment

## Rules
- Every chance/frequency/rate is calculated in base of 100. The higher, the more probable;
- When two microbios collide, there's a chance for they to fight or to reproduce;
	- If they are of opposite sex but same colony, they can only reproduce;
	- If they are of opposite sex and colony, they may attack or reproduce;
	- If they are of same sex, they only may attack each other;
- When reproducing, if there's a partner, the new born always variate;
- Parents are considered too close when they aren't more than 10 IDs apart and are from same colony;
